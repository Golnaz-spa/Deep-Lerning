# Object Detection with Deep Learning using Fashion MNIST Dataset

This script demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model for object detection using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset includes images of 10 types of clothing and accessories, making it a popular benchmark for classification tasks in machine learning. This guide covers data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Utilizes the `fashion_mnist` dataset from Keras for training and testing.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizes the pixel values of images for better model performance.
- **Model Building**: Constructs a neural network using Keras' Sequential API with two Dense layers.
- **Model Training**: Trains the model on the training data with a validation split for monitoring performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the model's performance on the test set.
- **Prediction**: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict the class of new images.
- **Model Saving and Loading**: Shows how to save the trained model to disk and load it for future predictions.

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess the Data**: Scale the pixel values of both the training and testing images.
2. **Define the Model**: Use Keras to build a Sequential model with layers designed for classification.
3. **Compile the Model**: Set up the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics for training.
4. **Train the Model**: Fit the model to the training data, using a portion of it for validation.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Test the model's performance on unseen data.
6. **Predict New Data**: Use the trained model to predict the category of new images.
7. **Save/Load the Model**: Save the trained model to disk and load it for future predictions.

## Notes

- Adjust the number of epochs based on the training performance and computational resources.
- Customize the neural network architecture to explore different model complexities.
- Ensure the new data for prediction is preprocessed in the same way as the training data.

This script is a straightforward introduction to using neural networks for image classification, providing a foundation for more complex object detection and image processing tasks.
